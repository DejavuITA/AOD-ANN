%\paragraph{WHY AM I DOING THIS WORK (project BACKUP)\\}
Furthermore, regarding the second objective, my work is part of a bigger project, BACUKP, with a wider scope and a more ambitious goal.
It attempts to connect three fields of research, normally quite distant from each other: physics, computing technology, and biology.
The main idea is to use the integrated photonics framework (physics) to build an artificial neural network (computing technology) on chip, where one could grow and, at least partially control, real neurons (biology).
The aim is to develop a methodologies and devices that will allow us to study neural activity from a bottom-up perspective.
