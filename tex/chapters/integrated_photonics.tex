%\section{Introduction}
%\label{sec:Photonics_intro}
To build an artificial neuromorphic network one has to choose first some physical phenomenon to employ in the fundamental blocks, likewise transistors in electronic circuits use the various behaviors of electrons in resistances, capacitors, and inductances.
The physics which I want to build my artificial neuromorphic network with is photonics, precisely integrated silicon photonics.

Photonics is the physical science which studies detection, manipulation, and emission of light.
Specificially, integrated photonics is the branch that studies how to reduce and \textit{integrate} once macroscopic optical devices in miniaturized structures.
In the past few decades, thanks to the constant improvement of the manufacturing techniques, many productive problems has been progressively resolved.
Moreover interest in the field is rising, driven by the growing needs of communication technology, which was in turn following the increase in computational power of electronics.
Many integrated devices have been proposed \cite{??} and some of them even commercialized \cite{??} .

Silicon photonics is the research field that studies how to integrate optical devices in structures built with silicon and materials derived from it.
Silicon is well-known material which has been widely studied in microelectronics.
It possesses many qualities which allow relatively easy manufacturing of high grade structures.
However there also some drawbacks, for example being a centrosymmetric element it does not possess nonlinearities of the second order.

% Many other devices such as Mach-Zenhder interferometers (MZI) and Directional Couplers (DC) have been demonstrated.

\section{Silicon Photonics}
\label{sec:Silicon_Photonics}
Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonics is one of the widest branches of integrated photonics.
It pursues the same objectives of all integrated photonics with the addition of following the production steps already developed for microelectronics.

Its framework is the silicon wafer, which is then altered by a often numerous series of production steps.
The first step is the burial of an insulator layer of $SiO_2$, called \textit{buffer}, which defines the bottom surface of the layer at the top.
The pure $Si$ volume at the top, the \textit{device} layer, is where integrated optical structures will be built with various processes like photolitography, thermal oxidation, ion implantation, and etching.

\end{figure}

The fact of relying on the SOI framework to build integrated devices is a strength of silicon photonics, because it enables researchers to develop CMOS compatible integrated optical structures.
Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility is an industry standard created to fabricate microelectronic devices.
Therefore by exploiting this standard all the know-how of the manufacturing industries behind the commercial microelectronic products is available to fabricate integrated photonics devices.

Moreover, by sharing the fabrication technology with microelectronic makes it easier to integrate electronic components to obtain hybrid integrated optoelectronic devices or to compensate lack of appropriate optical structures.

Hence silicon photonics is a promising technology for a combination of cost and technological reasons.
A list of advantages and disadvantages of silicon photonics in compared to other photonics technologies is provided in \autoref{tab:silicon_adv_and_disadv}.

\section{Guided-wave photonics}
\label{sec:guided-wave_photonics}
The most important thing for integrated photonics is the way light is confined and manipulated into microscopic structures.
While in conventional optics, light is delivered with bulky mirrors and lenses toward the desired position, in integrated photonics waveguides are the main device for this task.

\subsection{Waveguides}
\label{ssec:waveguides}
A waveguide is a path inside a medium, whose volume is defined by a certain number of interfaces between different materials, in which light remains confined and ideally travels with negligible losses.
This volume is called \textit{core} of the waveguide, while the medium external to it, if present, is called \textit{cladding.}

One can distinguish two types of waveguides: metallic and dielectric.
The former are based on the reflection of the electromagnetic field by the metallic surface.
Light is confined in the desired path by a series of metallic mirrors.
However, this mechanism works well only for electromagnetic radiation for which metals can still be considered \textit{perfect metals}.
For visible and infrared frequencies integrated metallic waveguides are not possible, due to too high absorption of the metals at optical frequencies.

On the other hand, dielectric waveguides are based on the phenomenon of total internal reflection (TIR) on the interface between two dielectric media.
To produce TIR, the two materials must have sufficiently different real part of the refractive index.
Moreover, they must also be transparent, i.e. they must have low imaginary part of the refractive index, in the required range of frequencies.
Hence not all media are suitable to build dielectric waveguides that work at a specific wavelength.
For example, silicon is known to be transparent for light at and around \SI{1.55}{\um}, among other wavelengths.
This feature together with a low distortion of signals is the reason why it is the most used wavelength in communication technology.

\subsubsection{Dielectric Waveguides}
\label{sssec:Dielectric_Waveguides}
Total internal reflection is the well-known phenomenon in which light coming from a material with high refractive index $n_H$ gets reflected at the interface with a material with low refractive index $n_L$.
For this to happen, incident light must be at an angle greater than the critical angle\index{critical angle} given by the Snell's law\index{Snell's law}:
\begin{equation*}
	\theta_C = \arcsin \left( \dfrac{n_L}{n_H}\right).
\end{equation*}

Waveguides have many shapes, however one can initially discriminate them by the dimensionality of the confinement of light.
The simplest one is called \textit{slab} and it is composed by two interfaces, which divides the material in three volumes, as shown in \autoref{fig:slabWG} below.
This type is classified as a 1D-waveguide, because it constrains light in only one dimension.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
%	\includegraphics[scale=.4]{figures/dielBC.pdf}
	\input{tikz/dielWG.tex}
	\caption{Scheme of a dielectric slab waveguide, made by two materials with refractive indexes $n_H$ and $n_L$, with $n_H>n_L$.
		Two rays are shown: the unguided one is incident on the interface at an angle smaller than the critical angle.
		Conversely the guided ray is incident at a greater angle and is therefore totally reflected inside the waveguide \cite{Saleh1991}.}
	\label{fig:slabWG}
\end{figure}

2D-waveguides on the other hand are more common, to the point that with the term waveguide one usually refers to a device belonging to this category.
Since they confine light in two dimension, their core then becomes a straight path with which one can conduct light from a place to another.
A few types are shown in \autoref{fig:2DVG} below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
%	\includegraphics[draft,width=9cm,height=6cm]{figures/foo.png}

		}
	\label{fig:2DVG}
\end{figure}

Obviously, the versatility of straight (2D-) waveguides is limited.
Hence more complex structures such as bent waveguides have been developed.

\paragraph{Propagation of light inside waveguides\\}
\noindent Light propagates inside waveguides as superposition of transverse electro-magnetic (TEM) waves which keep reflecting on the interfaces of the core.
The result of the superposition is the so called \textit{mode}, which is expressed mathematically by
\begin{equation}
	\phi(\textbf{r}) = \phi_m\left( x, y \right) e^{i\left( \beta_m z - \omega t \right)}.
	\label{eq:mode_propagation}
\end{equation}
$\phi_m\left( x, y \right)$ is the transverse field distribution, $z$ is the direction of propagation, $\beta_m$ is the propagation constant of the m-th mode, and $\omega=2\pi \nu$ is the angular frequency of light.
Each mode, identified by the $m$ idex, travels inside the waveguide with a certain propagation constant $\beta$ and maintaining a field distribution $\phi_m$.
Both of them depend on the materials and the geometry of the waveguide, however while $\beta_m$ decrease with increasing $m$ indexes, the features of the function $\phi_m$ grows in number.
Light either propagate in a manner described by a mode or superposition of modes or is rapidly scattered away.

The filed distribution of some of the first modes, in the simplest case of a slab waveguide, is represented in \autoref{fig:WGmodes} below.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/modes.png}\\
	\input{tikz/WGmodes.tex}
	\caption{Field distribution inside a slab waveguide.}
	\label{fig:WGmodes}
\end{figure}
The function inside the core is characterized by maxima, minima and nodes with a certain periodicity and the number of nodes (where the function is zero) is strictly linked to the index $m$.
Outside, the distribution of the field decays exponentially.
For waveguide with a 2D core, the field can be expected to be a multivariate version of the same or similar function.
However, differently from the analytical solution for slab waveguides, they are almost always found numerically.

The propagation constant can be written as
\begin{equation}
\beta_m = n_{eff} k_0 + i \alpha_{eff}
\end{equation}
where $k_0$ is the wavevector in vacuum, $n_{eff} \defeq c_0/v_{ph}$ is the \textit{effective refractive index}\index{effective refractive index} of the mode, and $\alpha_{eff}$ is \textit{effective absorption coefficient}\index{effective absorption coefficient}.
The effective refractive index is the ratio between the speed of light and the \textit{effective phase velocity} $v_{ph}$ at which each wavefront propagates in the core and its value is between the core refractive index and the cladding refractive index $n_L < n_{eff} < n_H$.

The physical interpretation of the effective index is that of an average refractive index \textit{felt} by the mode propagating as a whole, instead of a superposition of multiple TEM waves \textit{feeling} different refractive indexes depending on the specific medium in which they are propagating.
Similarly to the actual refractive index of materials, $n_{eff}$ is a complex number and the imaginary part is directly linked with the absorption properties of the materials.
Actually, a low imaginary part means that the material absorbs less and is therefore transparent to light.

All of these parameters which describe the propagation of light along the waveguide depends both on the materials and the geometry of the core and the cladding, but also on the frequency of light.
For dielectric waveguides, the fundamental mode ($m=0$) is always supported while higher modes might not be, depending both on the waveguides and on the frequency of light.
For this reason one distinguish \textit{single-mode} waveguides, which allow propagation for only the fundamental mode in a certain operative range of frequencies, from \textit{multi-mode} waveguides, which allow higher order modes to propagate.

Equation (\ref{eq:mode_propagation}) describes the propagation of a monochromatic light wave, which has ideally the same mode amplitude from $t=-\infty$ to $t=+\infty$.
This is obviously not a good physical representation, as light is generated and absorbed.
Eventually light is described to travel in wavepackets of finite duration, which are inherently non-monochromatic.

When light becomes non-monochromatic, the frequency dependence of the propagation constant $\beta$ has to be considered.
Usually, if working on a restricted range of frequencies, this dependence is characterized by a Taylor expansion at the first order.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\beta\left(\omega\right)
		&\simeq \beta\left(\omega'\right) + \frac{\partial \beta\left(\omega\right) }{\partial \omega} \Delta\omega \label{eq:beta_taylor}\\
		&\simeq \dfrac{1}{v_{ph}} \omega' + \frac{1}{v_g} \Delta\omega \label{eq:beta_taylor_v}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $1/v_{ph} = n_{eff}/c_0$, $\Delta\omega = \omega-\omega'$, and $v_g \defeq \left( \frac{\partial k}{\partial \omega}\right)^{-1}$.
The \textit{group velocity} $v_g$ describes the speed at which the ensemble of frequencies, the wavepacket, propagates.
Then, in a similar manner to $n_{eff}$ which is the ratio between $c_0$ and the effective phase velocity, one can define the \textit{effective group index} $n_{eff}^g$ as ratio between the speed of light in vacuum $c_0$ and the effective group velocity $v_g$ of a packet of light inside a waveguide:
\begin{equation}
	n_{eff}^g \defeq \dfrac{c_0}{v_g} = n_{eff}\left( \omega \right) +\omega\dfrac{\partial n_{eff}}{\partial \omega}.
	\label{eq:neff_group}
\end{equation}
The latter equation allow to describe the Taylor expansion of $\beta$ in other terms:
\begin{equation}
	\beta\left(\omega\right) \simeq \frac{n_{eff}}{c_0}\omega' + \frac{n_{eff}^g}{c_0} \Delta\omega
	\label{eq:beta_taylor_n}
\end{equation}
Nevertheless the monochromatic wave propagation model is still valid, because it is a very good approximation of slowly varying and almost monochromatic waves, such as the one I will use in my experiments.

\subsection{Microring Optical Cavity}
\label{ssec:Microring_Optical_Cavity}
In integrated photonics the microring is an optical cavity made by bending a waveguide on itself.
To insert light into the cavity, the microring is often side coupled with one or two straight waveguides.
Light inserted from the different ports into the cavity interfere with itself, after a round trip, and with each other.
When the waves are in phase, they generate constructive interference and the energy stored in the cavity increases exponentially.
On the other hand, when the signals are out of phase, the interference is destructive and the energy stored in the cavity remains low.

\end{figure}

In the simpler case when there is only one waveguide side coupled to the resonator the optical cavity has only two ports, which are usually called \textit{input} and \textit{through}.
This configuration, shown in \autoref{fig:APF_scheme}, is called \textit{All-Pass Filter}, because in the ideal case, where no losses happen, all the signal passes from the input to the through channels.
%All pass filter theory\\
All pass resonators have only one input and one output: light then propagate in only in one direction, unless some specific phenomena happens (e.g. back scattering).

By adding a secondary waveguide coupled to the ring, one obtains the so called Add-Drop Filter (ADF) configuration, shown in \autoref{fig:ADF_scheme}.
Its name derive by the fact that the two additional ports are called \textit{add} and \textit{drop} respectively.
This simple structure can be readily used as a signal mixer: signals at the resonance wavelengths of the cavity are directed from the input to the drop channel or from the add channel to the through port.
Additionally signals out of resonance travel straight from the input to the through channel and from the add to the drop port.
Resonators with more than four ports are possible, however are very uncommon.

The theoretical model usually employed to describe resonators analytically decomposes their structure in a series of simpler substructures.
Both the APF and the ADF configurations are studied as ordered combinations of straight waveguides and bent waveguides, which are coupled together in specific \textit{coupling regions}, as shown in \autoref{fig:coupling_scheme}.
Other used descriptions, such as numerical simulation obtained with finite element methods (FEM), achieve more precise results, however they are more dependent on the specific geometry of the problem.
Moreover the approximation given by the analytical model is sufficiently accurate to make clear the physics behind it and it can be expanded to include non-trivial phenomena (see \autoref{ssec:Nonlinear_Perturbations}).
In the following section I will go through the necessary steps to solve the case of the ADF configuration in the theoretical model.

%1.2.3.2 Add-drop filter theory\\
\subsubsection{Add-Drop-Filter theory}
\label{sssec:Add-Drop-Filter_theory}
ADF configuration is obtained when a microring is coupled to two waveguides.
Such structure is composed by three different basic structures: four straight waveguides, two bent waveguides which together form the whole ring, and two coupling regions between the waveguides and the microring.
Each of these pieces transfers light to or from the outside or another piece.

Since our experiments are carried out in a time scale such that physics phenomena can be considered quasi-static, the field propagating in the device is described by a scalar complex function which, assuming a monochromatic continuous EM wave, loses any temporal dependence:
\begin{equation}
	E(z) = |E(z_0)|e^{i\beta z},
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the direction of propagation, loosely defined to accommodate propagation both along straight and bent waveguides ($z\sim r\theta$), $t$ is time, $\omega=2\pi\nu$ is the angular frequency, and $\beta = n_{eff}k_0+i\alpha_{eff}$ is the propagation constant.
Both dependence of the effective index $n_{eff}=n_{eff}\left(\omega\right)$ and the effective loss factor $\alpha_{eff}=\alpha_{eff}\left(\omega\right)$ will be expanded only when necessary.

Propagation in the straight waveguides is often considered without loss (i.e. $\alpha_{eff}\approx 0$) and thus neglected.
On the other hand, propagation in the two halves of the ring is frequently considered with radiative losses (i.e $\alpha_{eff}> 0$), because a bent waveguide is intrinsically more difficult to fabricate in comparison to a straight one.
The last structure type, the coupler between the resonator and the waveguides, is considered alike a beamsplitter.
In this approximation, light does not propagate in this part as it was in the previous ones.
Its operation is reduced to the exchange of power between the two input ports and two output ports, which is described by the following matrices:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
E^{w+}_{ch} \\
E^{r+}_{ch} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \textbf{M}
\begin{pmatrix}
E^{w-}_{ch} \\
E^{r-}_{ch} \\
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \textbf{M} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\tau & i\kappa \\
i\kappa & \tau \\
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the field amplitude of the `$_{ch}$' channel either in the waveguide `$^w$' or in the ring `$^r$', before `$^-$' and after `$^+$' the coupling.
An explanatory diagram is shown in \autoref{fig:coupling_scheme}.
The matrix $\textbf{M}$ is characterized by two real valued parameters, $\tau$ and $\kappa$, between $0$ and $1$.
Specifically, they must verify the following constraint:
\begin{equation}
\det\left(\textbf{M}\right) = |\tau|^2 + |i\kappa|^2 = 1.
\end{equation}
which represents the conservation of energy.

At this point one can solve the problem by putting all the pieces together.
Neglecting the propagation inside the waveguide, the full system of equation that describe the problem is:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
E^{w+}_{in}	&= \tau 		 E^{w-}_{in} + i\kappa	E^{r-}_{in} \label{seq:in_w+}\\
E^{r+}_{in}	&= i\kappa	 E^{w-}_{in} + \tau 		E^{r-}_{in} \label{seq:in_r+}\\
\nonumber\\
E^{r-}_{out}	&= E^{r+}_{in}		e^{i\beta \pi R } \label{seq:out_r-_in}\\
E^{r-}_{in}	&= E^{r+}_{out}	e^{i\beta \pi R } \label{seq:in_r-_out}\\
\nonumber\\
E^{w+}_{out}	&= \tau 		 E^{w-}_{out} + i\kappa	E^{r-}_{out} \label{seq:out_w+}\\
E^{r+}_{out}	&= i\kappa	 E^{w-}_{out} + \tau 		E^{r-}_{out} \label{seq:out_r+}
\end{align}
\label{eq:ADF_equations}
\end{subequations}
The first two \cref{seq:in_w+,seq:in_r+} describe the exchange of optical power between the first channel and the microring resonator.
Then the third and fourth \cref{seq:out_r-_in,seq:in_r-_out} delineate the propagation of light in the two halves of the resonator, from one coupling region to the other.
Lastly the remaining two equation characterize the transfer of light between the resonator and the add-drop channel.

Using these equations it is easy to define new quantities of interest: the first one is transmittance from the \textit{input} to the \textit{through} port.
\begin{equation}
\eta_T\left(\omega\right) \defeq \dfrac{E^{w+}_{in}}{E^{w-}_{in}}
	= t\dfrac{1-e^{i\beta 2\pi R}}{1-\tau^2e^{i\beta 2\pi R}}
\end{equation}
Similarly, one can also define the transmittance from the \textit{input} to the \textit{drop} port.
\begin{equation}
\eta_D\left(\omega\right) \defeq \dfrac{E^{w+}_{out}}{E^{w-}_{in}}
	= \dfrac{-\kappa^2e^{i\beta\pi R}}{1-\tau^2e^{i\beta 2\pi R}}
\end{equation}

However, this quantities have complex values and therefore are difficult to study.
For this reason, one define also the transmission between the same ports as the square modulus of the transmittance.
Thus it follows that
\begin{equation}
T \left( \omega \right) \defeq |\eta_T|^2 = \tau 
\dfrac	{ \left( 1- 				\gamma \right)^2 + 4 				\gamma \sin^2 \left( n_{eff} k_0 \pi R \right) }
			{ \left( 1-\tau^2	\gamma \right)^2 + 4 \tau^2	\gamma \sin^2 \left( n_{eff} k_0 \pi R \right) }
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
D \left( \omega \right) \defeq |\eta_D|^2 =
\dfrac	{ \kappa^4 \gamma}
			{ \left( 1-\tau^2	\gamma \right)^2 + 4 \tau^2	\gamma \sin^2 \left( n_{eff} k_0 \pi R \right) }
\end{equation}
where the notation is simplified by loss parameter $\gamma = e^{\pi R\alpha_{eff}}$.
The dependence of $T=T(\omega)$ and $D=D(\omega)$ from the frequency (or wavelength) of light is obtained by making explicit the wavevector dependence $k_0=\frac{\omega}{c_0}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ in which $c_0$ is the universal constant speed of light in vacuum.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\input{tikz/ADF.tex}
	\caption{
		Transmission spectra of microring resonators in Add-Drop Filter configuration for the through and drop ports.
		The resonators considered differ in radius ($R=$\SI{4}{\um} and $R=$\SI{5}{\um}), but share the coupling constant $\tau=0.85$, the half round trip loss factor $\gamma=0.8$ and the effective index $n_{eff}=3.826$.
	}
	\label{fig:ADF}
\end{figure}

The transmission is much more interesting to study than the transmittance because it represents the ratio between the input and output optical powers ($I\propto |E|^2$), except for a constant factor, and is therefore a real valued function of $\omega$ instead of a complex one.
Both transmission spectra, as shown in \autoref{fig:ADF}, have either peaks or dips: the resonances of the microring.
Specifically, at each resonance, the through spectrum shows dips while the drop spectrum shows peaks.
The depth of the dips, the height of the peaks, and the width of both of them is defined by few parameters: the coupling constant $\tau$\footnote{one can choose also $\kappa$, but it does not matter which one, since $\tau^2 = 1-\kappa^2$} and the half round trip loss factor $\gamma = e^{-\pi R\alpha_{eff}}$.

The frequency of each resonance is identified by a positive integer number, that verifies the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	\omega_m = m\dfrac{c_0}{n_{eff}(\omega)R},
\end{equation}
where the dependence of $n_{eff}=n_{eff}\left(\omega\right)$ has been explicitly shown.
Moreover, it is easy to convert this quantity in other domains with:
\begin{equation}
	\omega = 2\pi\nu \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad c_0 = \nu\lambda
	\label{eq:omega_nu_lambda}
\end{equation}
Each resonance is spaced from the next one by a quantity called \textit{Free Spectral Range}\index{Free Spectral Range (FSR)} $FSR_{\omega_m}$.
By exploiting the Taylor expansion of $\beta$ seen in \cref{eq:beta_taylor_n} one obtains
\begin{equation}
	FSR_{\omega_m} \simeq \dfrac{c_0}{n_{eff}^g\left(\omega_m\right) R} .
\end{equation}
where the \textit{effettive group index} $n_{eff}^g\left(\omega\right)$ has been defined in \cref{eq:neff_group}.
Another important quantity is the width of the peaks or dips of each resonance.
Ordinarily one evaluate the so called \textit{full-width-half-maximum} (FWHM):
\begin{equation}
	FWHM_{\omega_m} = \dfrac{c_0}{n_{eff}^g\left(\omega_m\right)}\dfrac{1- \tau^2\gamma}{\pi R \tau \sqrt{\gamma}}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]

	The microring has a radius of \SI{5}{\um} and an effective index $n_{eff}=3.826$.

	The arrows indicate a $FSR_\nu \approx \SI{2.49}{\THz}$ and a $FWHM_\nu \approx \SI{0.3}{\THz}$, which gives a quality factor of around $Q \approx \num{650}$.

	\label{fig:ADF2}
\end{figure}

Values such this are often expressed in the wavelength domain: however to obtain the $FSR_\lambda$ one can not use \cref{eq:omega_nu_lambda}.
Instead the following relations have to be used:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta\omega = 2\pi \Delta \nu = \dfrac{2\pi c_0}{\lambda^2}\Delta\lambda
		\qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad
	\Delta\lambda = \dfrac{c_0}{\nu^2}\Delta\nu = \dfrac{2\pi c_0}{\omega^2}\Delta\omega
\end{equation}
By employing the first relation, one obtains
\begin{equation}
	FSR_{\lambda_m} \simeq \dfrac{\lambda_m^2}{n_{eff}^g\left(\lambda_m\right) 2\pi R}
		\qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad
	FWHM_{\lambda_m} \simeq	\dfrac{\lambda_m^2}{n_{eff}^g}
													\dfrac{1- \tau^2\gamma}{2\pi^2 R \tau \sqrt{\gamma}}
\end{equation}
where $n_{eff}^g\left(\lambda_m\right)$ is an appropriate redefinition of the effective group index in the wavelength domain.

An additional figure of merit of an optical microring resonator is the \textit{quality factor} $Q-factor$, or simply $Q$.
The quality factor has many similar definitions, depending on the field of study.
In the most physical, but less operative one defines it as $2\pi$ times the ratio between the energy stored in the cavity and the energy lost each cycle.
$$Q \defeq 2\pi \times \frac{\mathrm{energy~stored}}{\mathrm{energy~lost~per~cycle}}$$
However, for my purposes this definition is too cumbersome, thus a similar one is used instead:
\begin{equation}
Q \defeq \dfrac{\omega_m}{FWHM_{\omega_m}} = \dfrac{\lambda_m}{FWHM_{\lambda_m}}
\end{equation}
Both are sensible definitions and as $Q$ becomes larger they become approximately equivalent.

\subsubsection{Critical coupling}
\label{sssec:Critical_coupling}
Critical coupling/ over-coupling / under-coupling / enhancement factor

%\subsection{Light coupling}
%\label{ssec:light_coupling}
We covered how light travels inside a waveguide, now the problem on how to insert and extract light from it.
The process of inserting light into a waveguide is called \textit{coupling} and it often requires at the same time to extract light from another waveguide.

%subsubsection{End coupling}
%label{sssec:end_coupling}
The most naive way to insert light into a waveguide is obviously to use one of its ends.
This is achieved either by radiating a beam directly on the whole waveguide or by focusing it inside the core with some lensing mechanism (e.g. tapered optical fibers).

These methods are very simple, however they have a low coupling efficiency. % and are only able to access structures at perimeter of a chip.

%\subsubsection{Grating coupling}
%\label{sssec:grating_coupling}
% and prism coupling?
A more sophisticated way to couple light inside a waveguide is to use the so called \textit{grating coupler}.
A grating coupler is a periodic structure end coupled to a waveguide.
It is designed in a way such that light incident from free space above it, at a certain angle and with a specific wavelength, is coupled inside the waveguide.

%\subsubsection{Evanescent coupling}
%\label{sssec:evanescent_coupling}
Evanescent coupling exploits the fact that the evanescent field distribution outside the core decays exponentially to zero \cite{Reed2004}.
This means that when two waveguides are separated by a sufficiently small distance, the field distribution of one waveguide cannot decays sufficiently fast to zero and instead extends itself over the core of the second waveguide.
When this happens optical power can be transferred between the waveguides.
Therefore, if at the beginning light is propagating inside one waveguide, light is \textit{coupled} inside the other waveguide because its mode overlaps the core of the second waveguide.
Depending on the parameters of the problems, light can couple completely or partially between the waveguides.

This exchange of optical power is periodic with their length.

\subsection{Nonlinear Perturbations}
\label{ssec:Nonlinear_Perturbations}
In the precedent section, I considered the material of waveguides and resonators as a linear medium.
This is however only an approximation, because almost any material shows some sort of nonlinearity if probed with a high enough electromagnetic field.

In integrated photonics, due to the lateral confinement of the field inside the waveguide, much higher field amplitude are reached in comparison to free space.
Moreover, inside an optical cavity, such as an appropriately built microring resonator, the field reaches even more higher amplitudes thanks to its large enhancement factor and nonlinearities might arise.

Silicon response to light is almost linear.
However, a silicon optical cavity, by confinement and enhancement, can obtain a very high electromagnetic field inside, such that its response becomes significantly nonlinear.

One can distinguish two kinds of optical nonlinearities shown by silicon: electronic nonlinearities and thermal nonlinearities.

\subsubsection{Electronic nonlinearities}
\label{sssec:Electronic_nonlinearities}
Silicon is a centrosymmetric material and thus does not exhibit optical nonlinearities of even orders.
The most efficient nonlinear effects belong to the third order.

Silicon nonlinearities are mainly due to two fundamental effects of this category and their correlated effects.
\paragraph{Kerr effect}
The first one is the Kerr effect, which is given by the real part of the third order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ and it produces a change in the refractive index characterized by:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta n_{Kerr} = n_2 I,
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the intensity of light beam and $n_2$ is the second-order (or intensity dependent) nonlinear refractive index, defined by
\begin{equation}
	n_2 = \dfrac{3}{4\varepsilon_0 n_0^2 c_0} \mathcal{R}\mathrm{e} \left[ \chi^{(3)} \right]
	\overset{Si}{\simeq} \SI{0.45e-17}{\square\m\per\W}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Two photon absorption}
The other fundamental effect is the two photon absorption (TPA), which is linked instead to the imaginary part of the third order nonlinear susceptibility.
It does not produce a change to the real part of the refractive index but to its imaginary part, which is in turn linked to the absorption coefficient by $\alpha=2\mathcal{I}\mathrm{m}[n]\omega/c_0$:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta\alpha_{TPA} = \beta_{TPA} I,
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{TPA}$ is the TPA coefficient which is experimentally found to be
\begin{equation}
	\beta_{TPA} \overset{Si}{\simeq} \SI{0.79e-11}{\m\per\W}.
\end{equation}

As a consequence to the absorption of two photons, a free carrier is generated in the conduction band of silicon.
The presence of free carriers alters the refractive index in its real and imaginary parts as well with  two additional effects.

\subparagraph{Free carrier effects}
When free carriers are generated in the conduction band, they can either move around until they thermalize or they can absorb an incoming photon.
The first case is the \textit{free carrier dispersion} (FCD) effect, which affects the real part of the refractive index.
The second case is the \textit{free carrier absorption} (FCA) effect and affects the imaginary part of the refractive index.
Both effects are usually characterized as first order expansion, as follows:
\begin{align}
	n			\left(N	\right) &= n				\left(N_0\right) + \left.\dfrac{dn}{dN}\right|_{N_0} \Delta N \\
	\alpha	\left(N	\right) &= \alpha	\left(N_0\right) + \left.\dfrac{d\alpha}{dN}\right|_{N_0} \Delta N
\end{align}
where the value of the FCD and FCA coefficients is
\begin{equation}
	\left.\dfrac{dn}{dN}\right|_{N_0} \overset{Si}{\simeq} \SI{-1.73e-21}{\cubic\m}
	\qquad and \qquad
	\left.\dfrac{d\alpha}{dN}\right|_{N_0} \overset{Si}{\simeq} \SI{1.1e-15}{\square\m}
\end{equation}
respectively.

\subsubsection{Thermal nonlinearities}
\label{sssec:Thermal_nonlinearities}
The thermal nonlinearity of materials refractive index linked to their optical response is called \textit{thermo-optic effect} (TOE).
When light propagates inside a medium, a portion of the photons is absorbed.
Hence the material heats up and its refractive index changes.
To characterize this change usually a first order expansion is made:
\begin{equation}
	n\left(T\right) = n\left(T_0\right) + \left.\dfrac{dn}{dT}\right|_{T_0} \Delta T,
	\label{eq:TOC}
\end{equation}
where $\dfrac{dn}{dT}$ is called \textit{thermo-optic coefficient} and $\Delta T$ is the temperature shift.

In silicon waveguides, the shift in temperature is caused both by linear and nonlinear processes.
The linear process is characterized by the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$.
Similarly, the nonlinear processes of heat generation are linked to the nonlinear part of the absorption coefficient and are given mainly by the two photon absorption and by the free carrier absorption.

The thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) of silicon at \SI{300}{\K} is \cite{??} :
\begin{equation}
	\left.\dfrac{dn}{dT}\right|_{\SI{300}{\K}} = \SI{1.86e-4}{\per\K}.
	\label{eq:Si_TOC}
\end{equation}
Moreover, due to the fact that in silicon integrated structures the cladding is usually made by $SiO_2$, a thermally insulating material, the heat generated by the beam confined in the cavity will stay within the core, thus amplifying the effect even further.

\section{Integrated photonics applied to ANNs}
\label{sec:Integrated_photonics_applied_to_ANNs}
Since our experiments are carried out in a time scale such that physics phenomena can be considered quasi-static, we obtain also that the only nonlinear effect non negligible is the thermo-optic effect.

\subsection{Weighted sum of inputs}
\label{ssec:Weighted_Sum_of_inputs}
This has already been demonstrated and integrated widely, so it will not be the focus of this work.
Two example are the banks of microring resonators and the MZ interferometers.

\subsection{Nonlinear Activation Function}
\label{ssec:Nonlinear_Activation_Function}
As opposed to the mechanism for weighted sum, an optical phenomenon for the activation function in an integrated photonic circuit has yet to be proposed.
