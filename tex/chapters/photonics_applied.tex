\chapter{Photonics applied to ANNs}

How do I intend to create a hardware photonic ANN node?
\section{Weighted sum of inputs}
This has already been demonstrated and integrated widely, so it will not be the focus of this work.
\section{Nonlinear activation function}
On the other hand, a photonic nonlinear activation function has not yet been found.
This is where the focus of my work will be.
