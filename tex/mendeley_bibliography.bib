@article{Minsky1969,
abstract = {Perceptrons - the first systematic study of parallelism in computation - has remained a classical work on threshold automata networks for nearly two decades. It marked a historical turn in artificial intelligence, and it is required reading for anyone who wants to understand the connectionist counterrevolution that is going on today. Artificial-intelligence research, which for a time concentrated on the programming of ton Neumann computers, is swinging back to the idea that intelligence might emerge from the activity of networks of neuronlike entities. Minsky and Papert's book was the first example of a mathematical analysis carried far enough to show the exact limitations of a class of computing machines that could seriously be considered as models of the brain. Now the new developments in mathematical tools, the recent interest of physicists in the theory of disordered matter, the new insights into and psychological models of how the brain works, and the evolution of fast computers that can simulate networks of automata have given Perceptrons new importance. Witnessing the swing of the intellectual pendulum, Minsky and Papert have added a new chapter in which they discuss the current state of parallel computers, review developments since the appearance of the 1972 edition, and identify new research directions related to connectionism. They note a central theoretical challenge facing connectionism: the challenge to reach a deeper understanding of how "objects" or "agents" with individuality can emerge in a network. Progress in this area would link connectionism with what the authors have called "society theories of mind."},

@article{Rosenblatt1958,
abstract = {To answer the questions of how information about the physical world is sensed, in what form is information remembered, and how does information retained in memory influence recognition and behavior, a theory is developed for a hypothetical nervous system called a perceptron. The theory serves as a bridge between biophysics and psychology. It is possible to predict learning curves from neurological variables and vice versa. The quantitative statistical approach is fruitful in the understanding of the organization of cognitive systems. 18 references.},

@book{Saleh1991,
abstract = {In recent years, photonics has found increasing applications in such areas as$\backslash$n communications, signal processing, computing, sensing, display, printing, and$\backslash$n energy transport. Now, Fundamentals of Photonics is the first self-contained$\backslash$n introductory-level textbook to offer a thorough survey of this rapidly$\backslash$n expanding area of engineering and applied physics. Featuring a logical blend$\backslash$n of theory and applications, coverage includes detailed accounts of the primary$\backslash$n theories of light, including ray optics, wave optics, electromagnetic optics,$\backslash$n and photon optics, as well as the interaction of light with matter, and the$\backslash$n theory of semiconductor materials and their optical properties.$\backslash$n $\backslash$n Presented at increasing levels of complexity, these sections serve as building$\backslash$n blocks for the treatment of more advanced topics, such as Fourier optics and$\backslash$n holography, guidedwave and fiber optics, photon sources and detectors,$\backslash$n electro-optic and acousto-optic devices, nonlinear optical devices, fiber-$\backslash$n optic communications, and photonic switching and computing. Included are such$\backslash$n vital topics as:$\backslash$n $\backslash$n * Generation of coherent light by lasers, and incoherent light by$\backslash$n luminescence sources such as light-emitting diodes$\backslash$n $\backslash$n * Transmission of light through optical components (lenses, apertures, and$\backslash$n imaging systems), waveguides, and fibers$\backslash$n $\backslash$n * Modulation, switching, and scanning of light through the use of$\backslash$n electrically, acoustically, and optically controlled devices$\backslash$n $\backslash$n * Amplification and frequency conversion of light by the use of wave$\backslash$n interactions in nonlinear materials Detection of light by means of$\backslash$n semiconductor photodetectors$\backslash$n $\backslash$n Each chapter contains summaries, highlighted equations, problem sets and$\backslash$n exercises, and selected reading lists. Examples of real systems are included$\backslash$n to emphasize the concepts governing applications of current interest, and$\backslash$n appendices summarize the properties of one- and two-dimensional Fourier$\backslash$n transforms, linear-systems theory, and modes of linear systems.},

@article{McCulloch1943,
abstract = {Because of the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},
